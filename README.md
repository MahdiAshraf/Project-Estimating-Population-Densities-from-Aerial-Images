# Project-Estimating-Population-Densities-from-Aerial-Images
This project develops a machine learning model that learns to predict population sizes from Aerial images

There are 2 parts that combine to make this project:

1. Data gathering and extraction 
2. Building the model

The presentation report provides an end-to-end summmary of the efforts involved and the experiments that were executed.
